Write complete code to get the Nth node in a link list.
Write complete code to pair wise swap elements of a link list by changing the links.
Write efficient code to find the minimum difference between any pair in given unsorted array. e.g A{2,10,9,25} return 1(10-9).
Write code to print node at K distance from the root.
Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is SumTree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.
